* Design Notes for Does Compute
** Improvements 
*** Nested Boxes
*** Dots using a single image
** Bugs
*** Arrow area2D calls hit for clicks and overlaps of other arrows
This should be limited to only dots. 
**** Fix
Add different collision shapes for different collision types or 
add a script to the area2D which sorts the different types of collision
and send the appropriate signal type. 
*** Keyboard input sometimes doesn't register till after a mouse click
_input function in Main is not called by the engine.
*** List of saves overlaps the line input for the name in save menu
*** List of saves in load and save menus doesn't fit in the menu
Try scrolling or growing the box or both
*** Cursor not visible over GUI elements
*** The user can attempt to overlap Boxes but this doesn't work properly
*** Movement jerks at the point that the dots spawn
**** Memory allocation?
Can use dots from a preallocated pool.
