* Design Notes for Does Compute
** TODO In Arrow, remove the need for all arrows to have the same parent.
** TODO Zoom to the centre of the screen rather than the origin 
** TODO Replace background crosses with a material (they slow everything down)
** Bugs
*** Arrow area2D is call hit for clicks and overlaps of other arrows
This should be limited to only dots. 
**** Fix
Add different collision shapes for different collision types or 
add a script to the area2D which sorts the different types of collision
and send the appropriate signal type. 
*** Keyboard input sometimes doesn't register till after a mouse click
_input function in Main is not called by the engine.
